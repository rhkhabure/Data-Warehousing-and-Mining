## Problem statement
How can the bank segment its customers based on their demographics, financial behaviour, and marketing interactions to improve targeted marketing strategies?

## Objective
Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical clustering) to identify distinct customer segments and tailor marketing campaigns to each segment to maximize engagement and conversion rates.

## Vairable and data selection
The variables selected for analysis were specifically those that were present in both datasets and were deemed to hold significant relevance based on prior research

Poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown", "other", "failure", "success")

### Data source
The data sets were sourced from Kaggle, a well-known provider of diverse datasets. The two selected data sets were carefully chosen for their similarities in structure, maintaining consistent formatting methods and being comparable in size, each containing a significant number of records.
